### ‚ö° High Priority
1. Component verification for JLCPCB availability
2. PCB layout with proper CAN bus impedance control
3. Generate manufacturing files for prototype

### üîç Discovered During Work
- Need to verify TJA1050T vs TJA1050 package availability
- Consider RJ45 connector with integrated magnetics vs separate
- Power supply design: determine if 5V boost needed for CAN transceiver
- EMI considerations for CAN differential signals
- **Added during schematic work (2025-06-02)**:
  - ESP32-C3-MINI-1 footprint verification needed
  - I2C pull-up voltage selection (3.3V vs 5V)
  - Programming interface pinout confirmed
  - Status LED current limiting resistor values
- **Corrected from prototype analysis (2025-06-02)**:
  - **CRITICAL**: Added missing 4x JST 2.0mm sensor connectors (VCC/GND/D0-D3)
  - CAN RX protection: TJA1050 RXD ‚Üí 10kŒ© resistor ‚Üí GPIO7 (D7)
  - CAN TX: GPIO6 (D6) ‚Üí TJA1050 TXD
  - Changed to 5V power supply (AMS1117-5.0) for sensor compatibility
  - Removed I2C interface from RJ45 (not used in actual design)

### üìù Notes
- Reference design shows compact form factor with ESP32 module
- RJ45 connector appears to be standard 8P8C type
- Board dimensions approximately 80mm x 30mm
- Red enclosure suggests this is for industrial/prototyping use
- **Schematic Design Complete**: Full electrical design with all components and connections
- **Prototype Verified**: Schematic now matches actual implementation in photo

### üéØ Success Criteria
