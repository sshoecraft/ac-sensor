# AC-Sensor PCB - Task List

## Project: ac-sensor
**GitHub Repository**: ac-sensor  
**Description**: ESP32-C3 CAN Bus + I2C sensor board with custom RJ45 pinout

## Current Tasks (June 2, 2025)

### üîÑ Active Tasks

- [ ] **PCB Layout** - Route the PCB with CAN + I2C interfaces
- [ ] **Design Rule Check** - Validate against JLCPCB manufacturing specs
- [ ] **Generate Manufacturing Files** - Gerbers, drill files, BOM, CPL

### üìã Completed Tasks
- [x] **Project Planning** - Analyzed reference design and requirements (2025-06-02)
- [x] **Prototype Analysis** - Updated design based on actual prototype image (2025-06-02)
- [x] **Component Selection Update** - Switched to terminal blocks, added boost converter (2025-06-02)
- [x] **PCB Schematic Design** - Complete KiCad schematic with custom RJ45 pinout (2025-06-02)
- [x] **Hardware Directory Structure** - Created KiCad project files and directories (2025-06-02)

### ‚ö° High Priority
1. Component verification for JLCPCB availability
2. PCB layout with proper CAN bus impedance control
3. Generate manufacturing files for prototype

### üîç Discovered During Work
- Need to verify TJA1050T vs TJA1050 package availability
- Consider RJ45 connector with integrated magnetics vs separate
- Power supply design: determine if 5V boost needed for CAN transceiver
- EMI considerations for CAN differential signals
- **Added during schematic work (2025-06-02)**:
  - ESP32-C3-MINI-1 footprint verification needed
