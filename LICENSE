CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Permissive

Preamble

CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the freedom to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs and products based on those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence comes in three variants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and two reciprocal licences: CERN-OHL-W (weakly reciprocal) and CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).

The CERN-OHL-P is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in unmodified form only.

Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any Licensor or their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in their development.

1 Definitions

1.1 'Licence' means this CERN-OHL-P.

1.2 'Source' means information such as design files, design documents, that allows others to make or manufacture a product based on the design.

1.3 'Covered Source' means Source that is explicitly made available under this Licence.

1.4 'Product' means any device, component, work or physical object, whether in finished or intermediate form, arising from the use, application or processing of Covered Source.

1.5 'Make' means to create or configure something, whether by manufacture, assembly, compiling, loading or applying Covered Source or another Product or otherwise.

1.6 'Notice' means copyright, acknowledgement and trademark notices, references to the location of any notices, modification notices (subsection 3.3(b)) and all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties that are included in the Covered Source.

1.7 'Licensee' or 'You' means any person exercising rights under this Licence.

1.8 'Licensor' means any person who creates Source or modifies Covered Source and subsequently communicates the resulting Covered Source under the terms and conditions of this Licence.

2 Applicability

2.1 This Licence governs the use, copying, modification, Notices and distribution of Covered Source and Products made using Covered Source.

3 Copying, Modifying and Distributing Covered Source

3.1 You may copy and distribute Covered Source, in any medium, provided that You include conspicuously and appropriately on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this Licence applies to the Covered Source; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Covered Source a copy of this Licence.

3.2 You may modify Covered Source, other than Notices, provided that You irrevocably undertake to make that modified Covered Source available from a publicly accessible location should You communicate any Product made using the modified Covered Source. The modified Covered Source must be available for as long as the Products are sold or distributed.

3.3 If You modify Covered Source, You may add Your name and a reference to the modification in the Notices.

4 Making and Distributing Products

You may Make Products, and distribute them in any medium, provided that You do not impose any further restrictions on the recipients as to the use of Covered Source or Products that those recipients Make, beyond those restrictions imposed by this Licence.

5 DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY

5.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY -- The Covered Source and any Products are provided 'as is' and any express or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, of satisfactory quality, non-infringement of third party rights, and fitness for a particular purpose or use are disclaimed in respect of any Source or Product to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Licensor makes no representation that any Source or Product does not or will not infringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right. The entire risk as to the use, quality, and performance of any Source or Product shall be with You and not the Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of this Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights granted under this Licence.

5.2 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY -- The Licensor shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, have no liability for direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive or other damages of any character including, without limitation, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of use, data or profits, or business interruption, however caused and on any theory of contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way in relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered Source and/or the making or use of any Product, even if advised of the possibility of such damages, and You shall hold the Licensor(s) free and harmless from any liability, costs, damages, fees and expenses, including claims by third parties, in relation to such use.

6 Patents

6.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section 6.1) patent licence to Make, have Made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Covered Source and Products made using the Covered Source, where such licence applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Licensor that are necessarily infringed by exercising rights under the Covered Source as Conveyed by that Licensor.

6.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Covered Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licence granted to You under this Licence for the Covered Source or Products shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

7 General

7.1 If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall remain effective.

7.2 This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor acting as such, and third party beneficiary rights are specifically excluded.
